_As an Agent, we'll observe and configure information of this ticket._

_Having the entire mobile online banking down is something that could have a major impact on the company, resulting in losing money. The severity on this should be higher and should be assigned to the departments/teams that can be responsible to resolve this issue ASAP!_
- Set Priorty from Normal to a higher level (this example uses **Emergency**).
- Assign to a higher-tier department (this example uses **System Administrators**).
- Assign a specific person(s) the responsbility to manage this ticket (this example uses the current user, **Jane Doe**).
- Modify the SLA Plan from Normal to a higher level (this example uses **SEV-A**).
